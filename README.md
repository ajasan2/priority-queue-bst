# BST With Duplicate Priorities

This project implements a library that provides a priority queue using a Binary Search Tree (BST). A unique feature of this implementation is its support for duplicate priorities. The main header file for the priority queue implementation can be found in the `Google_tests` folder.

## Benefits and Use Cases

The implementation of a priority queue using a BST that supports duplicate priorities has several benefits and use cases:

- **Efficient Operations**: BSTs provide efficient insert, delete, and search operations, which are crucial for priority queues.
- **Support for Duplicate Priorities**: Most priority queue implementations do not handle duplicate priorities well. This implementation provides robust support for such scenarios.
- **Versatility**: This implementation can be used in a variety of applications, including scheduling systems, traffic management, and data compression algorithms.

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (like g++, clang, or Microsoft Visual C++)
